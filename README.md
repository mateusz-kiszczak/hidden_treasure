## How to use

1. Press one of three 'level' buttons to start the game.
2. Use WSAD keys on a keyboard or the app buttons to move the character (character = @).
3. Find your way to the treasure (treasure = $).
4. Avoid the holes as you can fall into them (hole = o).
5. You can not go back or use the same field twice (not accessible field = *).
